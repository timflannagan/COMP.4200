Chapter 9: Adversarial Search
- Search overview:
  • Expectimax overview:
    - Deal with average-case now when outcomes are uncertain
    - Previously we dealt with worst-case in minimax, but that
      assumes outcomes are certain and the other adversary is playing
      optimally, which isn't always the case.
  • Hard to prune expectimax like we can do with minimax
    - This is because we could find 1M in the pruned children
  • Depth-limited expectimax
  • For worst-case minimax, the terminal evaluation scale doesn't matter
    as we want better states to have higher evaluations. The thing that
    does matter is the ordering of the states.
  • For average-case expectimax, the magnitudes need to be reasonable.
  • The dangers of optimism and pessimism:
    - Don't want to assume chance when the world is adversarial, and
      don't want to assume worst-case when that's not likely.
  • Expectiminimax tree:
    - Environment is where there's an extra player that moves after each
      min/max agent.

- Probability overview:
  • Random variable: represents a variable whose outcome is unknown.
  • Probability distribution: assignment of weights to outcomes.
  • Basic laws:
    - Probabilities cannot be negative.
    - Probabilities of one outcome sum to 1.

- Search for non zero-sum games:
  • Every agent acts to maximize their utility.
    - This means that some agents may work together in some situations
      in order to maximize their utility.
    - This cooperation or competition between the agents in the world
      is done dynamically.
  • Principle of maximum expected utility:
    - A rational agent should maximize its expected utility, given its
      knowledge.
      • This implies expectimax, and not minimax.
  • We hardwire utilities, and let behaviors emerge.

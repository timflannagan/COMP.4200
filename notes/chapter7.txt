Propositional Logic:
1. Portions of the world must be represented in a KNOWLEDGE BASE, or KG
   • A KB is composed of sentences in a language with logic.
   • Interact with a KB using ASK and TELL functions:
     - Examples:
       1. ASK(KB, a): yes       # exactly when a follows from the KB
       2. TELL(KB, a): KB'      # so that a follows from KB'
       3. FORGET(KB, A) = KB'   # non-monotonic (will not be discussed)
2. There are three distinguishable levels to representing knowledge:
   a. The knowledge level: an abstraction to a KB. Concerns the total knowledge.
   b. The logical level: encoding of knowledge in a formal language.
   c. The implementation level: the internal representation of the sentences.
3. Bringing it together:
   • A knowledge-based agent uses its KB for the following purposes:
     a. Represent its background knowledge
     b. Store its observations
     c. Store its executed actions
     d. Derive actions
4. The Wumpus World:
   • Grid layout is 4x4.
   • The agent perceives a STENCH when the square containing the wumpus is
     directly in adjacent squares.
   • The agent perceives a BREEZE in squares that are adjacent to a pit.
   • The agent perceives a GLITTER in the square that contains gold.
   • The agent perceives a BUMP when the agent walks into a wall.
   • When wumpus is KILLED, the scream is HEARD throughout the board.
   • We reperesent all these perceptions using a five-tuple:
     - Percepts = (stench, breeze, glitter, none, none)
       • The agent can perceive a stench, breeze, and glitter at the same time.
       • The agent CANNOT perceive its own location.
   • Actions:
     1. Go forward.
     2. Turn right by 90 degrees.
     3. Turn left by 90 degrees.
     4. Grab: pick up an object in the same square.
     5. Shoot: there is only one arrow.
     6. Leave: only works in the square [1, 1] to leave the cave.
   • Goal of game: find the gold and leave the cave.
5. Declarative Languages:
   • Must be able to express knowledge before a system capable of LEARNING,
     THINKING, PLANNING, EXPLAINING, can be build.
   • Declarative: system believes P iff it considers P to be TRUE
   • Precise: we must know the following -
     - Which symbols represent sentences.
     - What it means for a sentence to be true.
     - When a sentence follows from other sentences.
6. Basics of Propositional Logic:
   • Propositions: the building blocks are indivisible, atomic statements.
   • Logical connectives (and, or, not) are used to build FORMULAE.
   • Interested in finding the following:
     a. When is a proposition true?
     b. When does a proposition follow from a KB?
        - Symbolically: KB |= a
     c. Can we define the concept of DERIVATION.
        - Symbolically: KB |- a
     - This is the meaning and implementation of ASK.
   • Logical formulae:
     - Atomic formulae, falseness, truth, negation, conjunction, disjunction,
       implication, and equivalence.
     - Order precedence:
       • atom (atomic formula) > literal (atomic formula) > clause (disjunction of literals).
   • The KB can be thought of as a SET of sentences or a SINGLE sentence that ASSERTS ALL the
     individual sentences.

Crossover Operators:
1. One point crossover: a random crossover point is chosen, and the tails of its
   two parents are swapped to get new off-springs.

   lst1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
   lst2 = [5, 8, 9, 4, 2, 3, 5, 7, 5, 8]

   crossover_index = 4

   lst3 = lst1[0:4] + lst2[0: 4]
   lst4 = lst1[4: ] + lst2[4: ]

   new_lists = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5, 7, 5, 8], [5, 8, 9, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

2. Multi-point Crossover: generalization of one-point crossover wherein alternating
   segments are swapped to get new off-springs.
3. Uniform Crossover: don't divide the chromosome into segments, but rather treat
   each gene separately. Essentially flipping a coin for each chromosome to decide
   whether or not it'll be included in the off-spring. We can also bias the coin to
   one parent, to have more genetic material in the child from that parent.

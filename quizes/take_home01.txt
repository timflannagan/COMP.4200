1a.) Breadth-First Search is a special case of uniform-cost search.
True. If all the step costs are equal, then breadth-first search is very
similar to uniform-cost search. One of the main differences here is that
once a goal state is generated, breadth-first search will terminate its search,
and return that solution, whereas uniform-cost search will continue examining
nodes to see if one has a lower path cost.
1b.) Depth-first Search is a special case of best-first tree search.
1c.) Uniform-cost Search is a special case of A*.
